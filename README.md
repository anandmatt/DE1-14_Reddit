# DE1-14_Reddit
Data Engineering Mini-Project on Reddit Comments for Group 14

This repository consists of the two different architectures that were tried out by our group to experiment on the Reddit Comments Dataset - One making use of Docker and one without.

The instructions for the setup **without** Docker can be found at: [INSTRUCTIONS.MD](SPARK_HDFS_CLUSTER_SETUP/INSTRUCTIONS.MD).

The instructions for the setup **with** Docker can be found at: [Instructions.md](SPARK_DOCKER_SWARM_SETUP/Instructions.md).

All the VMs that were used were initialised using the script [vm_init](vm_init.sh)

The analysis was carried out using [analysis](analysis.ipynb)
